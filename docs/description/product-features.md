# Product Features

The core features of this Service Desk Portal Integration include:

- **Centralized Ticket Submission:** Users can submit new support tickets directly from the Cloudeka Service Portal.
- **Bi-directional Ticket Synchronization:** Ensures that ticket details, status updates, discussions, and attachments are synchronized between the Cloudeka Service Portal and ServiceDesk Plus.
- **User Ticket Monitoring Dashboard:** Provides users with a comprehensive view of their submitted tickets, including current status and history, on the Cloudeka Service Portal.
- **Collaborative Discussion:** Facilitates communication between users and the operation team through a chat-like discussion interface on both portals.
- **Attachment Management:** Allows both users and the operation team to upload and view relevant files and images associated with a ticket.
- **Historical Tracking:** Maintains a permanent record of all submitted tickets (including closed ones) for users' reference.
- **Ticket Lifecycle Management and Statuses:** The system tracks the progress of each ticket through a defined lifecycle. Key statuses for tickets include:
  - **Open / New:** This is the initial state of a ticket upon submission by the user, indicating it is awaiting initial review or assignment by the operation team. This status applies to both "Information Request" and "Problem Report" tickets.
  - **Assigned:** The ticket has been reviewed and formally assigned to a specific technician or support group within the operation team.
  - **In Progress / Working:** The assigned operation team member is actively engaged in addressing the ticket, which may involve investigating the problem, gathering information, or preparing a response.
  - **Pending / On Hold:** The progress of the ticket is temporarily paused because external information or action is required. This may include waiting for additional details from the user, a response from a third-party vendor, or a scheduled system change.
  - **Resolved:** The operation team has completed the necessary actions, believing the problem has been fixed or the information request has been fulfilled. The solution or information has been provided to the user, and the ticket is awaiting user confirmation for final closure.
