# User Interface

The user interface for the Cloudeka Service Portal will be enhanced to include the following key screens and elements for ticket management:

- **Create Ticket Form:** Users will access a form to create new tickets. This form includes fields for "Subject Ticket", "Project Name", "Request Type Ticket" (dropdown: Information Request, Problem Report), "Priority Ticket" (dropdown: Minor, Major, Critical), "Product" (dropdown: specific Cloudeka GPU products), and "Description" (text area). It will also feature "Cancel" and "Submit" buttons.
- **Ticket Dashboard:** A list view displaying all tickets submitted by the user. It will show "Ticket Number", "Subject", "Priority", "Project", "Request Type", "Site", "Created Date", and "Status". Users can filter by "Project Name", "Request Type", and "Status". Pagination and "Items per page" will be available. A "+ Create Ticket" button will lead to the creation form.
- **Ticket Detail View:** Provides detailed information for a selected ticket, including "Ticket Number", "Subject", "Product Name", "Request Type", "Project Name", "Priority", "Site", "Status", and "Description". It will also have a "Discussion" section for text-based communication and an "Attachment" tab for file management.
